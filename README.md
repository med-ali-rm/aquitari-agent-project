# Aquitari Vita Agent

This project is being built for **Commit To Change: An AI Agents Hackathon**.  
It is still a work in progress and will be updated until completion.  

---

## ⚠️ Important Note

- The agent is being developed with **n8n** and will also integrate with **Opik** for observability (additional Opik integrations will be documented once finalized).  
- **New day is a fresh page** → conversations do not carry over from yesterday to today.  
- The workflows will be added to the project folder once finished.
- Since the app uses a **Large Language Model (LLM)**, you should **not enter personal details** — I cannot control or delete what the LLM itself may generate or retain internally.

## Development Status
This project is still under active development.  
Scripts may not run without setting certain variables (e.g. Redis, environment configuration).  
The knowledge graph JSON file included in `brain-api/data` is just a **starting file**.  It will be updated and expanded as development progresses until the final version is ready.
